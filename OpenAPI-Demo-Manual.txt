Demo API - to integrate 3rd Party API (Plaid - Sandbox)

Platform/languages : .net 6.0 & c#

APIKEY: testkey
clientid/secret are in app settings files and will change once check it out demo

API Functions: 
	Controller: (BankAccountController.cs) calls class object BankAccount.cs
		GetAccounts()  -- List of all accounts available at that moment (Async calls)
		GetAccount(string AccountSubType) // AccountSubType = checking, savings, mortgage etc. (Async calls)

	Controller:	OpenAPITest (In-Memory DB details) - Manual CRUD or INSERT from above PLAID apis
		GET, POST, DELETE (all)

	
Main Classes Inv
	BankAccount -- to fetch data from Plaid API and dump into In-Mem EFcontext
	Token class -- to fetch public and access token of Plaid API based .


Helper classes 
	Masking of PII data before logging using middleware (JsonHelper.cs)
	Middleware of Swagger/OpenAPI to access with ApiKey only (ApiKeyMiddleware.cs)
	Added Header parameter with each API on OpenAPI (AddRequiredHeaderParameter)
	
DI used for 
	ILogger - SeriLog 
	IConfiguration
	DetailDb -- for dbcontext

Model/Contract Classes 
	PlaidServiceContract.cs  - to deserialize data from Plaid json to objects
	Detail.cs/DetailDb.cs - IN memory using EF context

UI - default from OPENAPI 

Default API key to access - 'Test'  --- can be set to any GUID in configuration
	If I had some more time could create JWT token or HASH comparison. -- tried to implement, if you notice some commented code blocks with region/endregion statements. Due to some architectural changes in .net 6.0 I needed more time. But doable. 

Tried few SOLID patterns like SRP, DIP, ISP . I could explore more if time permitter to analyse Plaid API response to split into different interfaces of BankAccount (Checking/Saving/Mortgage etc).

Data Store - Used EF - In memory context and provided apis too

Masked account-id data by replacing its some characters to * before dumping into Serilog.

This is just a logical testing of core pieces and sure it has lot of improvements as it grows.
